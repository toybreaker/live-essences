### My intention is to share what I have learned

My name is Iris. I was raised in a Greek and a German world. Grandmother Yaya was a mountain farmer full of vigour from a tiny village in the island of Crete. She fed my summers with wonderful stories of plants and natural wisdom.

In Munich, I used to spend hours watching grandmother Oma crafting, with engineer precision, stylish and beautiful dresses with my my aunt. I now find myself doing the same, with plants!

I moved to Bali in 2000, after years on the road exploring Asia, and myself. I started launching a fashion business. My creativity sparked. I felt unstoppable!

Bali was taking me back to the warmth, simplicity, energising and nature-honouring lifestyle of Greece.

I realised that by reconnecting with the essence of my childhood, I was creating a new sense for my life, and looking towards an exciting future.

Today, I have put all these feelings into 5 intense Essences, crafted with ancient and modern wisdom.

My intention is to share with you all that I have learned, and all that has brought me happiness and fulfilment in the hope that this helps you on your own journey. With love, Iris.
